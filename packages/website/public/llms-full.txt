## Product Overview

Skillsmith is an agent skill platform for AI-powered development tools. It provides a searchable registry of 14,000+ curated skills from 20,000+ on GitHub — reusable prompts, workflows, and configurations that extend AI assistant capabilities.

Skills are YAML files installed to `~/.claude/skills/` that provide:
- Domain-specific knowledge and best practices
- Reusable workflows and templates
- Tool configurations and integrations
- Project-type-specific guidance

## Installation

### MCP Server (Recommended)

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., `~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillsmith": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@skillsmith/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your MCP client after adding the configuration.

### CLI Alternative

```bash
npm install -g @skillsmith/cli
skillsmith search testing
skillsmith install jest-helper
```

## MCP Tools (API)

When using the MCP server, these tools are available:

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `search` | query, category, trust_tier, min_score, limit | Search skills by keyword or semantic query |
| `get_skill` | id (format: author/name) | Get detailed skill information |
| `install_skill` | id | Install skill to ~/.claude/skills/ |
| `uninstall_skill` | id | Remove an installed skill |
| `recommend` | context (optional) | Get project-based skill recommendations |
| `validate` | path | Validate a skill's YAML structure |
| `compare` | ids (2-5 skill IDs) | Compare skills side-by-side |

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `skillsmith search <query>` | Search for skills | `skillsmith search testing` |
| `skillsmith install <id>` | Install a skill | `skillsmith install jest-helper` |
| `skillsmith uninstall <id>` | Remove a skill | `skillsmith uninstall jest-helper` |
| `skillsmith list` | List installed skills | `skillsmith list` |
| `skillsmith recommend` | Get project recommendations | `skillsmith recommend` |
| `skillsmith info <id>` | Show skill details | `skillsmith info jest-helper` |
| `skillsmith compare <ids>` | Compare skills | `skillsmith compare jest-helper vitest-helper` |
| `skillsmith sync` | Sync skill registry | `skillsmith sync` |
| `skillsmith status` | Show sync status | `skillsmith status` |
| `skillsmith config` | Manage configuration | `skillsmith config set apiKey sk_live_...` |

Short alias: `sklx` (e.g., `sklx search testing`)

## Authentication

### Methods (in priority order)

1. **Personal API Key** (recommended): `X-API-Key: sk_live_*` header or config file
2. **Supabase Anon Key**: Built-in fallback, 30 requests/minute
3. **No Auth**: 10 trial requests total

### API Key Configuration

Option 1 — Config file (cross-platform):
```json
// ~/.skillsmith/config.json
{ "apiKey": "sk_live_your_key_here" }
```

Option 2 — MCP server environment:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillsmith": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@skillsmith/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "SKILLSMITH_API_KEY": "sk_live_your_key_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Shell `export` does NOT work for MCP servers. They run as subprocesses and don't inherit shell environment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What are agent skills?
A: Skills are reusable prompts and workflows installed to ~/.claude/skills/ that give AI assistants specialized capabilities like testing, deployment, code review, and documentation generation.

Q: Is Skillsmith free?
A: Yes. The Community tier is free forever with 1,000 API calls per month. Paid plans start at $9.99/month for developers who need more.

Q: What AI tools does it work with?
A: Skillsmith works with any MCP-compatible client including Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other tools that support the Model Context Protocol.

Q: How do I install a skill?
A: Add the Skillsmith MCP server to your settings.json, then ask your assistant "Install the [skill-name] skill." Skills install to ~/.claude/skills/ in one step.

Q: What counts as an API call?
A: Each skill search, recommendation request, or skill installation counts as one API call. Viewing cached results does not count.

Q: Can I change plans at any time?
A: Yes, upgrade or downgrade at any time. Changes take effect at the next billing cycle.

Q: What happens if I exceed my API limit?
A: You'll be notified at 80% and 90% usage. Once exceeded, calls are rate-limited until the next cycle or until you upgrade.
