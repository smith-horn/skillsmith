# SPARC Architect Mode

## Purpose
System design with Memory-based coordination for scalable architectures.

## Activation

### Option 1: SPARC methodology (skill + phase agents)

SPARC is not an MCP tool in ruflo v3 -- there is no `mcp__ruflo__sparc_mode` (or similarly named) tool. Use the `sparc-methodology` skill for full SPARC-workflow guidance, and dispatch the `specification`, `pseudocode`, `architecture`, or `refinement` subagent_type via the Agent tool for phase-specific work within a SPARC cycle (e.g. `design microservices architecture`).

### Option 2: SPARC CLI is unavailable in v3

The `sparc` subcommand does not exist in ruflo v3 (`npx -y ruflo@3.14.2 sparc --help` returns `[ERROR] Unknown command: sparc`) -- there is no CLI equivalent to `sparc run architect "..."`. Use the `sparc-methodology` skill for SPARC-workflow guidance, or dispatch a role-specific subagent via the Agent tool for `architect`-type work (e.g. `design microservices architecture`).
