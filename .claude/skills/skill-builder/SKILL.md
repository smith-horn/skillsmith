# Skill Builder

## What This Skill Does

Creates production-ready Claude Code Skills with proper YAML frontmatter, progressive disclosure architecture, and complete file/folder structure. This skill guides you through building skills that Claude can autonomously discover and use across all surfaces (Claude.ai, Claude Code, SDK, API).

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code 2.0+ or Claude.ai with Skills support
- Basic understanding of Markdown and YAML
- Text editor or IDE

## Quick Start

### Creating Your First Skill

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory (MUST be at top level, NOT in subdirectories!)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-first-skill

# 2. Create SKILL.md with proper format
cat > ~/.claude/skills/my-first-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: "My First Skill"
description: "Brief description of what this skill does and when Claude should use it. Maximum 1024 characters."
---

# My First Skill

## What This Skill Does
[Your instructions here]

## Quick Start
[Basic usage]
EOF

# 3. Verify skill is detected
# Restart Claude Code or refresh Claude.ai
```

---

## Complete Specification

### 📋 YAML Frontmatter (REQUIRED)

Every SKILL.md **must** start with YAML frontmatter containing exactly two required fields:

```yaml
---
name: "Skill Name"                    # REQUIRED: Max 64 chars
description: "What this skill does    # REQUIRED: Max 1024 chars
and when Claude should use it."       # Include BOTH what & when
---
```

#### Field Requirements

**`name`** (REQUIRED):
- **Type**: String
- **Max Length**: 64 characters
- **Format**: Human-friendly display name
- **Usage**: Shown in skill lists, UI, and loaded into Claude's system prompt
- **Best Practice**: Use Title Case, be concise and descriptive
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "API Documentation Generator"
  - ✅ "React Component Builder"
  - ✅ "Database Schema Designer"
  - ❌ "skill-1" (not descriptive)
  - ❌ "This is a very long skill name that exceeds sixty-four characters" (too long)

**`description`** (REQUIRED):
- **Type**: String
- **Max Length**: 1024 characters
- **Format**: Plain text or minimal markdown
- **Content**: MUST include:
  1. **What** the skill does (functionality)
  2. **When** Claude should invoke it (trigger conditions)
- **Usage**: Loaded into Claude's system prompt for autonomous matching
- **Best Practice**: Front-load key trigger words, be specific about use cases
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Generate OpenAPI 3.0 documentation from Express.js routes. Use when creating API docs, documenting endpoints, or building API specifications."
  - ✅ "Create React functional components with TypeScript, hooks, and tests. Use when scaffolding new components or converting class components."
  - ❌ "A comprehensive guide to API documentation" (no "when" clause)
  - ❌ "Documentation tool" (too vague)

#### YAML Formatting Rules

```yaml
---
# ✅ CORRECT: Simple string
name: "API Builder"
description: "Creates REST APIs with Express and TypeScript."

# ✅ CORRECT: Multi-line description
name: "Full-Stack Generator"
description: "Generates full-stack applications with React frontend and Node.js backend. Use when starting new projects or scaffolding applications."

# ✅ CORRECT: Special characters quoted
name: "JSON:API Builder"
description: "Creates JSON:API compliant endpoints: pagination, filtering, relationships."

# ❌ WRONG: Missing quotes with special chars
name: API:Builder  # YAML parse error!

# ❌ WRONG: Extra fields (ignored but discouraged)
name: "My Skill"
description: "My description"
version: "1.0.0"       # NOT part of spec
author: "Me"           # NOT part of spec
tags: ["dev", "api"]   # NOT part of spec
---
```

**Critical**: Only `name` and `description` are used by Claude. Additional fields are ignored.

---

### 📂 Directory Structure

#### Minimal Skill (Required)
```
~/.claude/skills/                    # Personal skills location
└── my-skill/                        # Skill directory (MUST be at top level!)
    └── SKILL.md                     # REQUIRED: Main skill file
```

**IMPORTANT**: Skills MUST be directly under `~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/`.
Claude Code does NOT support nested subdirectories or namespaces!

### 🎯 Progressive Disclosure Architecture

Claude Code uses a **3-level progressive disclosure system** to scale to 100+ skills without context penalty:

#### Level 1: Metadata (Name + Description)
**Loaded**: At Claude Code startup, always
**Size**: ~200 chars per skill
**Purpose**: Enable autonomous skill matching
**Context**: Loaded into system prompt for ALL skills

```yaml
---
name: "API Builder"                   # 11 chars
description: "Creates REST APIs..."   # ~50 chars
---
# Total: ~61 chars per skill
# 100 skills = ~6KB context (minimal!)
```

#### Level 2: SKILL.md Body
**Loaded**: When skill is triggered/matched
**Size**: ~1-10KB typically
**Purpose**: Main instructions and procedures
**Context**: Only loaded for ACTIVE skills

```markdown
# API Builder

## What This Skill Does
[Main instructions - loaded only when skill is active]

## Quick Start
[Basic procedures]

## Step-by-Step Guide
[Detailed instructions]
```

#### Level 3+: Referenced Files
**Loaded**: On-demand as Claude navigates
**Size**: Variable (KB to MB)
**Purpose**: Deep reference, examples, schemas
**Context**: Loaded only when Claude accesses specific files

```markdown
# In SKILL.md
See [Advanced Configuration](docs/ADVANCED.md) for complex scenarios.
See [API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) for complete documentation.
Use template: `resources/templates/api-template.js`

# Claude will load these files ONLY if needed
```

**Benefit**: Install 100+ skills with ~6KB context. Only active skill content (1-10KB) enters context.

### 🎨 Content Best Practices

#### Writing Effective Descriptions

**Front-Load Keywords**:
```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Keywords first
description: "Generate TypeScript interfaces from JSON schema. Use when converting schemas, creating types, or building API clients."

# ❌ BAD: Keywords buried
description: "This skill helps developers who need to work with JSON schemas by providing a way to generate TypeScript interfaces."
```

**Include Trigger Conditions**:
```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Clear "when" clause
description: "Debug React performance issues using Chrome DevTools. Use when components re-render unnecessarily, investigating slow updates, or optimizing bundle size."

# ❌ BAD: No trigger conditions
description: "Helps with React performance debugging."
```

**Be Specific**:
```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Specific technologies
description: "Create Express.js REST endpoints with Joi validation, Swagger docs, and Jest tests. Use when building new APIs or adding endpoints."

# ❌ BAD: Too generic
description: "Build API endpoints with proper validation and testing."
```

#### Progressive Disclosure Writing

**Keep Level 1 Brief** (Overview):
```markdown
## What This Skill Does
Creates production-ready React components with TypeScript, hooks, and tests in 3 steps.
```

**Level 2 for Common Paths** (Quick Start):
```markdown
## Quick Start
```bash
# Most common use case (80% of users)
generate-component MyComponent
```
```

**Level 3 for Details** (Step-by-Step):
```markdown
## Step-by-Step Guide

### Creating a Basic Component
1. Run generator
2. Choose template
3. Customize options
[Detailed explanations]
```

**Level 4 for Edge Cases** (Reference):
```markdown
## Advanced Configuration
For complex scenarios like HOCs, render props, or custom hooks, see [ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md).
```

---

### 🛠️ Adding Scripts and Resources

#### Scripts Directory

**Purpose**: Executable scripts that Claude can run
**Location**: `scripts/` in skill directory
**Usage**: Referenced from SKILL.md

Example:
```bash
# In skill directory
scripts/
├── setup.sh          # Initialization script
├── validate.js       # Validation logic
├── generate.py       # Code generation
└── deploy.sh         # Deployment script
```

Reference from SKILL.md:
```markdown
## Setup
Run the setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Validation
Validate your configuration:
```bash
node scripts/validate.js config.json
```
```

#### Resources Directory

**Purpose**: Templates, examples, schemas, static files
**Location**: `resources/` in skill directory
**Usage**: Referenced or copied by scripts

Example:
```bash
resources/
├── templates/
│   ├── component.tsx.template
│   ├── test.spec.ts.template
│   └── story.stories.tsx.template
├── examples/
│   ├── basic-example/
│   ├── advanced-example/
│   └── integration-example/
└── schemas/
    ├── config.schema.json
    └── output.schema.json
```

Reference from SKILL.md:
```markdown
## Templates
Use the component template:
```bash
cp resources/templates/component.tsx.template src/components/MyComponent.tsx
```

## Examples
See working examples in `resources/examples/`:
- `basic-example/` - Simple component
- `advanced-example/` - With hooks and context
```

---

### 🔗 File References and Navigation

Claude can navigate to referenced files automatically. Use these patterns:

#### Markdown Links
```markdown
See [Advanced Configuration](docs/ADVANCED.md) for complex scenarios.
See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you encounter errors.
```

#### Relative File Paths
```markdown
Use the template located at `resources/templates/api-template.js`
See examples in `resources/examples/basic-usage/`
```

#### Inline File Content
```markdown
## Example Configuration
See `resources/examples/config.json`:
```json
{
  "option": "value"
}
```
```

**Best Practice**: Keep SKILL.md lean (~2-5KB). Move lengthy content to separate files and reference them. Claude will load only what's needed.

---

---

## Behavioral Classification (ADR-025)

Every skill should declare its **behavioral classification** to set user expectations and guide Claude's interaction pattern. See [ADR-025](../../docs/adr/025-skill-behavioral-classification.md) for the full decision record.

### The Four Classifications

| Classification | Directive | When to Use |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Execution** | EXECUTE, DON'T ASK | Prescribed workflows with no decisions needed |
| **Guided Decision** | ASK, THEN EXECUTE | Requires user input on specific choices |
| **Interactive Exploration** | ASK THROUGHOUT | Ongoing dialogue is the value |
| **Configurable Enforcement** | USER-CONFIGURED | Behavior depends on project settings |

### 1. Autonomous Execution

**Directive**: EXECUTE, DON'T ASK

Skills that follow a prescribed workflow with no decisions required. They should execute automatically without asking for permission.

**Examples**:
- `governance` - Code review findings actioned immediately
- `hive-mind-execution` - Executes planned waves
- `docker-enforce` - Enforces container patterns

**Template Addition**:
```markdown
## Behavioral Classification

**Type**: Autonomous Execution

This skill executes automatically without asking for permission. When invoked:
1. The prescribed workflow runs immediately
2. Findings are actioned (fixed or tracked)
3. Results are reported

**Anti-pattern**: "Would you like me to run the code review?"
**Correct pattern**: *Runs code review, reports findings, actions them*
```

### 2. Guided Decision

**Directive**: ASK, THEN EXECUTE

Skills that require user input on specific decisions, then execute based on those choices. They ask structured questions at defined points.

**Examples**:
- `wave-planner` - Asks about scope, then generates plan
- `mcp-decision-helper` - Guides through decision matrix
- `skill-builder` - Asks classification, then generates

**Template Addition**:
```markdown
## Behavioral Classification

**Type**: Guided Decision

This skill will ask for your input on key decisions, then execute based on your choices.

**Decision Points**:
1. [First question - e.g., "Which scope?"]
2. [Second question - e.g., "Which approach?"]
3. [Third question - e.g., "Create ADR?"]

After decisions are made, execution proceeds automatically.
```

### 3. Interactive Exploration

**Directive**: ASK THROUGHOUT

Skills that engage in ongoing dialogue. The interaction IS the value.

**Examples**:
- `dev-browser` - Continuous web automation interaction
- `researcher` - Explores topics based on feedback
- `pair-programming` - Collaborative coding discussion

**Template Addition**:
```markdown
## Behavioral Classification

**Type**: Interactive Exploration

This skill engages in ongoing dialogue. Expect frequent questions and discussion as we explore together.

**Interaction Pattern**:
- I'll ask clarifying questions as we go
- Provide feedback to steer the exploration
- We'll iterate until you're satisfied
```

### 4. Configurable Enforcement

**Directive**: USER-CONFIGURED

Skills that adapt based on project configuration.

**Examples**:
- `varlock` - Block vs warn mode
- `security-auditor` - Severity thresholds from config
- `ci-doctor` - Strictness based on environment

**Template Addition**:
```markdown
## Behavioral Classification

**Type**: Configurable Enforcement

This skill's behavior depends on your project configuration.

**Configuration Options**:
| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `mode` | `strict`, `warn`, `off` | `warn` |
| `severity_threshold` | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | `high` |

Configure in `config.yaml` or `.claude/settings.json`.
```

### Choosing a Classification

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does the skill need user input to work? │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │                        │
        YES                       NO
         │                        │
         ▼                        ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Is input needed │     │ Autonomous Execution │
│ throughout, or  │     └──────────────────────┘
│ just upfront?   │
└─────────────────┘
    │           │
  UPFRONT   THROUGHOUT
    │           │
    ▼           ▼
┌────────────┐  ┌───────────────────────┐
│  Guided    │  │ Interactive           │
│  Decision  │  │ Exploration           │
└────────────┘  └───────────────────────┘

Exception: If behavior depends on config → Configurable Enforcement
```
