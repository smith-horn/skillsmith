# Phase 4 Coordination - UX Researcher to Behavioral Designer

**From:** UX Researcher
**To:** Behavioral Designer
**Date:** December 31, 2025
**Re:** Epic 2 & Epic 4 Research Deliverables - Review Requested

---

## Purpose

This document coordinates handoff of UX research deliverables to Behavioral Designer for Epic 2 (Quick Wins Onboarding) collaboration. The research provides foundational insights for your Epic 2 tasks:

- **Epic 2, Task 3:** Design Contextual Welcome Experience
- **Epic 2, Task 4:** Build Instant Value Feedback

---

## Research Deliverables Summary

### 1. First-Impression Skills Research
**Location:** `docs/phase4-research/first-impression-skills-research.md`

**Key insights for UX design:**

#### Auto-Install Strategy (Phase 1)
```
Welcome to Skillsmith! Setting up essential skills...

✓ varlock - Secure environment variable management
✓ commit - AI-powered git commit messages
✓ governance - Code quality enforcement

All skills ready! Try: "Write a commit message"
```

**Design Requirements:**
- Non-intrusive welcome message (dismiss-able)
- Clear value proposition for each auto-installed skill
- Immediate call-to-action ("Try: [example prompt]")
- Progress indicator during installation (<5 seconds total)

#### Contextual Suggestions (Phase 3)
```
✓ Great commit message! I noticed this project uses Docker.
  Would you like to install the 'docker' skill for container management?

  [Install docker] [Not now] [Never suggest]
```

**Design Requirements:**
- Max 1 suggestion per 5 minutes (avoid interruption)
- Appear after successful skill use (positive reinforcement)
- Clear value proposition ("for container management")
- Permanent opt-out option ("Never suggest")
- One-click installation

### 2. Skill Ranking by Onboarding Effectiveness

| Rank | Skill | Score | Why It Works | UX Implication |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | varlock | 95/100 | Immediately masks secrets | Show security icon, "Protected" badge |
| 2 | commit | 92/100 | Instant commit message | Demo with example output |
| 3 | governance | 88/100 | Standards audit in <10s | Show checklist UI, clear pass/fail |
| 4 | docker | 85/100 | Container starts in 25s | Progress bar during setup |

**Design Insight:** Skills ranked highly score 8+ on "Instant Visibility" - users must SEE value within 60 seconds.

**UX Recommendation:** For each auto-installed skill, design a "first success" moment that happens within 60 seconds of welcome message.

---

### 3. User Testing Protocol for Validation

**What needs UX design:**

#### Test Scenario 1: Fresh Install
**User task:** "Install Skillsmith and explore available skills"

**UX elements to validate:**
- [ ] Welcome message clarity (comprehension test)
- [ ] Auto-install progress visibility (user notices it happening)
- [ ] Call-to-action effectiveness ("Try: [prompt]" → user tries it)
- [ ] Time to first value (target: <60 seconds)

#### Test Scenario 2: Contextual Suggestions
**User task:** "Work on your current project using installed skills"

**UX elements to validate:**
- [ ] Suggestion timing (feels helpful, not intrusive)
- [ ] Suggestion content (value proposition clear)
- [ ] Action buttons (labels intuitive)
- [ ] Opt-out mechanism (easy to find, clear consequence)

**Success Metrics:**
- ✓ ≥80% comprehend welcome message without help
- ✓ ≥70% try first skill within 60 seconds
- ✓ ≥50% accept at least 1 contextual suggestion
- ✓ ≤20% find suggestions intrusive

### 4. Value Measurement Framework

**Location:** `docs/phase4-research/value-measurement-framework.md`

**Relevant to your UX work:**

#### Dimension 3: Cognitive Load Reduction
Skills that reduce mental effort score higher on satisfaction. Design should minimize:

| Cognitive Load Source | Design Mitigation |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| "What should I try first?" | Welcome message includes example prompt |
| "Is this output good?" | Show confidence indicator, verification UI |
| "Did the skill work?" | Clear success/failure feedback |
| "What did the skill do?" | Attribution ("Generated by commit skill") |

#### Dimension 5: Satisfaction & Trust
Trust is built through:
1. **Transparency** - Show what skill is doing ("Analyzing git diff...")
2. **Verification** - Allow user to review before accepting
3. **Attribution** - Make value visible ("Saved 75 seconds")
4. **Control** - Easy undo/rollback

**UX Recommendation:** Every skill output should include:
- Who generated it (skill name + icon)
- What it analyzed (input summary)
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Option to verify/edit before accepting

## Collaboration Requests

### Request 1: Welcome Experience Mockups
**For:** Epic 2, Task 3 - Design Contextual Welcome Experience

**Based on research findings:**
- Auto-install flow (Tier 1 skills: varlock, commit, governance)
- Project context detection (background, no user action)
- First suggestion timing (after first successful skill use)

**Deliverables needed from you:**
- [ ] Welcome message wireframes (CLI-friendly format)
- [ ] Auto-install progress indicator design
- [ ] First suggestion notification design
- [ ] Opt-out UI flow

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (to inform MCP Specialist implementation)

---

### Request 2: Instant Value Feedback Design
**For:** Epic 2, Task 4 - Build Instant Value Feedback

**Based on research findings:**
- Users need to SEE value within 60 seconds
- Attribution builds trust ("Generated by commit skill")
- Time savings should be visible ("Saved 75 seconds")

**Deliverables needed from you:**
- [ ] Skill output attribution design (inline? metadata? badge?)
- [ ] Value visibility design (time saved, quality improved)
- [ ] First-use celebration (milestone UI)
- [ ] Example prompt suggestions (contextual help)

**Timeline:** Week 2-3 (before user testing validation)

---

### Request 3: User Testing Facilitation Guide
**For:** Validation of your UX designs

**I've created a user testing protocol** (see first-impression-skills-research.md, "User Testing Validation Protocol")

**Can you review and add:**
- [ ] Specific UX elements to observe (your design artifacts)
- [ ] Success criteria for your designs (e.g., "≥80% understand welcome message")
- [ ] Edge cases to probe (e.g., "What if user dismisses welcome?")

**Timeline:** Week 3 (before recruiting participants)

---

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Welcome message format:** Should it be a banner, modal, or CLI message? What's least intrusive but still noticeable?

2. **Suggestion frequency:** Research suggests max 1 per 5 minutes. Do you agree? Should it be configurable?

3. **Trust signals:** What visual indicators build trust in skill outputs? (verified badge? author name? confidence score?)

4. **Attribution placement:** Where should skill attribution appear? (inline in output? metadata header? separate panel?)

5. **First success celebration:** Should we celebrate first skill use? If so, how? (toast? badge? stats update?)
