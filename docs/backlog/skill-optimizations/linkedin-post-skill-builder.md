# LinkedIn Post: Skill Builder Introduction

---

**Cut your AI coding costs by 40-90% with one architecture change.**

Most teams using Claude Code don't realize their AI agent is wasting tokens on every task. The problem? Skills run in the main conversation, flooding context with intermediate outputs that the model never needs to see again.

The fix is surprisingly simple: run each skill in its own isolated agent.

I built a skill-builder that does this automatically. When you create a new skill, it generates:

✅ The skill itself (instructions for Claude)
✅ A specialist agent configured to run that skill in isolation
✅ Integration snippets for your project

**Why this matters:**

Your AI agent has a 200K token budget. Fill it with noise and performance degrades. Keep it lean and you get faster, more accurate results—and lower API costs.

One team measured 97% token reduction on multi-step research tasks using this pattern.

**Who this is for:**

→ Product managers building AI workflows
→ Engineers implementing Claude Code in production
→ Anyone tired of hitting context limits mid-task

The skill-builder is open for testing. Drop a comment or DM if you want early access.
