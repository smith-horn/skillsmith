## Purpose

Launch channels provide the initial awareness spike needed to:
1. Validate product-market fit
2. Gather early feedback
3. Seed the community
4. Establish presence before competitors

**Timeline:** Phase 0-1 (Weeks 1-8)

## 1. Awesome Lists

### 1.1 Overview

Awesome lists are curated GitHub repositories that aggregate high-quality resources. They have:
- Built-in SEO (GitHub ranks well)
- Credibility through curation
- Steady, long-tail traffic

### 1.2 Target Lists

| List | Stars | Relevance | Acceptance Rate | Priority |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| awesome-claude | 2K+ | Direct | ~60% | P0 |
| awesome-mcp | 500+ | Direct | ~70% | P0 |
| awesome-ai-coding | 5K+ | Adjacent | ~40% | P1 |
| awesome-vscode | 20K+ | Extension | ~30% | P2 (Phase 2) |

### 1.3 Submission Strategy

**Requirements for acceptance:**
- Quality README with clear value proposition
- Active development (recent commits)
- Minimal, focused scope (not kitchen sink)
- License present

**Submission timing:**
- Submit after Phase 1 launch (need working product)
- Space submissions 1 week apart (avoid spam perception)
- Follow up politely after 2 weeks if no response

### 1.4 Expected Results

| Metric | Expectation | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Acceptance rate | 2-3 of 4 | 60% baseline, quality submission |
| Installs per acceptance | 30-50 (first month) | Based on similar tool submissions |
| Long-tail installs | 10-15/month ongoing | Steady discovery traffic |
| **6-month total** | **100-150 installs** | Conservative estimate |

### 1.5 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| All rejections | Focus on product quality; resubmit after improvements |
| List becomes inactive | Target multiple lists; don't depend on single list |
| Competitor gets listed first | Move fast; submit within first week of launch |

---

## 2. Community Soft Launch

### 2.1 Claude Discord

**Channel:** Anthropic's official Claude Discord server

**Approach:**
1. Become genuine community member first (1-2 weeks before launch)
2. Help others with skill-related questions
3. Soft launch as "something I built to solve X problem"
4. NOT promotional; share genuinely useful insights

**Expected results:**
- 50-100 curious users
- 20-30 actual installs
- Valuable feedback from power users

### 2.2 Reddit r/ClaudeAI

**Subreddit stats:** ~100K members, moderate activity

**Approach:**
1. Post as "Show r/ClaudeAI: I built a skill discovery tool"
2. Focus on problem solved, not features
3. Include GIF/video demo
4. Engage actively with comments
5. Cross-post to r/ClaudeCode if exists

**Expected results:**
- 20-50 upvotes (realistic)
- 20-30 installs
- Community feedback

### 2.3 Timing Considerations

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Pre-launch -14d | Join communities, participate genuinely |
| Pre-launch -7d | Seed conversations about skill discovery pain |
| Launch day | Soft launch in Discord |
| Launch day +1 | Reddit post |
| Launch day +3 | Follow up on feedback, iterate |

## 3. Hacker News

### 3.1 Reality Check

From Growth Engineer review:

> "HN Show posts average 5-20 upvotes. Front page requires exceptional timing + luck. ~10% of launches get meaningful traction."

**Decision:** Attempt, but don't depend on it.

### 3.2 HN Strategy (If Attempted)

**Optimal conditions:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am ET
- Clear, compelling title
- Working demo available
- Prepared for front-page traffic

**Title options:**
- "Show HN: Claude skill discovery with quality scoring and activation verification"
- "Show HN: I built a tool to find Claude Code skills that actually work"

**Expected results:**

| Scenario | Probability | Installs |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Front page (100+ points) | 10% | 200-500 |
| Moderate traction (20-50 points) | 30% | 50-100 |
| Minimal traction (<20 points) | 60% | 10-30 |

**Weighted expectation:** ~50-100 installs

### 3.3 Alternative: HN Comments

Lower effort, more reliable approach:
1. Monitor HN for Claude/AI coding discussions
2. Comment helpfully when relevant
3. Include link to project when natural
4. Build reputation over time

This is more sustainable than one-time launch post.

## 4. Technical Community Outreach

### 4.1 DevRel Email Outreach

**Target:** Developer advocates at Anthropic and related companies

**Approach:**
1. Short, specific email
2. Focus on how this helps their users
3. Ask for feedback, not promotion
4. Include working demo

**Template:**
```
Subject: Claude skill discovery tool - feedback request

Hi [Name],

I'm building a skill discovery tool for Claude Code users
that helps find quality skills and verify they'll actually
activate.

Given [company's] focus on [relevant area], I'd value
your feedback on whether this addresses a real need.

Demo: [link]
5-minute overview: [link]

Would you have 15 minutes this week?

[Signature]
```

**Expected results:**
- 10% response rate
- 1-2 meaningful conversations
- Potential for amplification if impressed

### 4.2 Influencer Seeding

**Target:** Developers with 5K+ Twitter/YouTube followers who cover AI coding

**Approach:**
1. Identify 10-15 relevant influencers
2. Use product genuinely, provide feedback
3. Don't ask for promotion directly
4. If impressed, they'll share organically

**Expected results:**
- 2-3 organic mentions
- 100-300 impressions per mention
- 10-30 installs from mentions
