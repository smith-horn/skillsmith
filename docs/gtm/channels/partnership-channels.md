## Purpose

Partnership channels provide acceleration and legitimacy. They're high-impact but low-probability or long-timeline. Pursue them, but don't depend on them.

**Timeline:** Phase 2-4 (Weeks 9-20+)

---

## 1. Anthropic Partnership

### 1.1 Reality Check

From Growth Engineer review:

> "Anthropic has no incentive to acquire a community project when they can build their own with full ecosystem data access."

**Probability assessment:**
- Official endorsement: 5-15% (in first 6 months)
- Feature integration: 10-20% (in first 12 months)
- Acquisition: <5% (ever)

### 1.2 Partnership Tiers

| Tier | What It Means | Probability | Impact |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Tier 1: Mention** | Listed in community resources | 30% | Low |
| **Tier 2: Endorsement** | Recommended by DevRel | 15% | Medium |
| **Tier 3: Integration** | Built into Claude Code | 10% | Very High |
| **Tier 4: Acquisition** | Anthropic acquires project | 5% | Exit |

### 1.3 Approach Strategy

**Wrong approach:** Ask for partnership directly.

**Right approach:** Become undeniably useful.

**Tactics:**
1. Build something Anthropic users love
2. Reduce support burden (activation diagnostics help Anthropic)
3. Generate positive community sentiment
4. Make integration obviously beneficial

**Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-12: Build, ship, gather users
- Week 12+: If 500+ WAU, initiate conversation
- Week 16+: If 1,000+ WAU, propose specific integration

### 1.4 Conversation Openers

**If we have traction:**
```
Subject: Discovery Hub - 1,000+ weekly active users

Hi [Anthropic DevRel],

Discovery Hub now has 1,000+ weekly active Claude Code users
who use it to discover and verify skill quality.

We've reduced skill activation support questions in the
community by [X%] through our activation auditor.

Would you be interested in discussing how we might
integrate more deeply with Claude Code?

```

**Key:** Lead with user value, not our needs.

### 1.5 Mitigation if No Partnership

**Build unique assets Anthropic can't easily replicate:**
- Community quality signals
- Author relationships
- Learning curriculum
- Historical usage data

**Diversify platform dependency:**
- Support other AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot)
- Open-source core for forking

## 2. Community Partnerships

### 2.1 Skill Marketplace Aggregators

**Target:** skillsmp.com, claude-plugins.dev, etc.

**Value exchange:**
- We send them traffic (skill detail links)
- They link to our quality scores/recommendations
- Cross-promotion in respective communities

**Approach:**
```
Subject: Quality scoring partnership

Hi [aggregator],

I'm building Discovery Hub, which provides quality scoring
and activation verification for Claude skills.

I noticed you index {X} skills. Would you be interested in
displaying our quality scores alongside your listings?

We'd link to your site for full skill details, and you'd
display our quality badge.

Example badge: [image]

Interested in exploring?
```

### 2.2 Learning Platform Partnerships

**Target:** Egghead, Frontend Masters, Fireship, etc.

**Value exchange:**
- We provide curriculum content
- They provide audience access
- Co-branded learning experience

**Approach (Phase 4):**
- Only after own learning path is validated
- Only if 3,000+ WAU demonstrates demand
- Propose guest content or skill recommendations integration

### 2.3 Open Source Project Integrations

**Target:** Popular repos that could benefit from Claude skills

**Examples:**
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright) - recommend testing skills
- React frameworks (Next.js, Remix) - recommend frontend skills
- Build tools (Vite, Turbo) - recommend build skills

**Approach:**
1. Create genuinely useful skill for their ecosystem
2. Document it well, make it high quality
3. Open PR to add to their "ecosystem" or "resources" page
4. Include Discovery Hub as discovery mechanism

---

## 3. Influencer Partnerships

### 3.1 Target Profile

**Ideal influencer:**
- 5K-50K followers (accessible, engaged audience)
- Focus on developer tools or AI coding
- Active on Twitter/YouTube/Twitch
- Has tried Claude Code

**Examples:**
- AI coding YouTubers
- Developer tool reviewers
- Build-in-public developers

### 3.2 Partnership Types

| Type | What We Provide | What They Provide | Investment |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Review** | Free access + support | Honest review | Low |
| **Sponsored** | Fee + access | Promotional content | High |
| **Integration** | Skill built for their workflow | Organic mention | Medium |
| **Ambassador** | Dashboard, badges, early access | Ongoing advocacy | Medium |

### 3.3 Outreach Strategy

**Phase 2 (Weeks 9-12):**
1. Identify 20 potential influencers
2. Follow and engage genuinely (2 weeks)
3. Send personalized outreach (not template)
4. Offer value first (skill recommendations for their projects)

**Template (if must use template):**
```
Hey [name],

I saw your [specific video/tweet] about [specific topic].

I'm building something that might be relevant - a skill
discovery tool for Claude Code that verifies skills
actually work before recommending them.

Given your focus on [their area], I thought you might
find it interesting. Happy to give you early access
and build a custom recommendation for your workflow.

No pressure to promote - just think you'd find it useful.
