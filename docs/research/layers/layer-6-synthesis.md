# Layer 6 Synthesis: Feasible Influence

**Research Synthesis Date:** December 26, 2025
**Framework:** Teresa Torres Layer 6 - "What can we feasibly influence?"
**Total Sources Analyzed:** 30+

---

## Executive Summary

Layer 6 research examined what Discovery Hub can realistically change versus must accept, required partnerships, and capability requirements. The core finding:

> **A window of opportunity exists: The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) has just formed, creating neutral governance for agent interoperability. Discovery Hub can establish quality standards and federation protocols before the ecosystem solidifies. Acting now positions Discovery Hub as infrastructure, not competitor.**

## Key Finding 1: AAIF Creates Strategic Window

### What Happened (December 9, 2025)

The Linux Foundation formed the Agentic AI Foundation with unprecedented industry cooperation:

| Contributor | Contribution |
|-------------|--------------|
| Anthropic | MCP protocol |
| OpenAI | AGENTS.md |
| Block | Goose framework |
| Microsoft, Google, AWS | Foundation support |

### Why This Matters

> "OpenAI has been an early adopter and core contributor to Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), incorporating it as the foundation for apps in ChatGPT."

**Before AAIF:** Each vendor building proprietary ecosystem
**After AAIF:** Industry-wide standards under neutral governance

### Strategic Implication

**Discovery Hub built on MCP + Agent Skills can reach:**
- Claude Code (native)
- ChatGPT Apps (via MCP)
- VS Code/GitHub Copilot (via Skills)
- Any AAIF-compatible agent

**Window Duration:** 6-12 months before official AAIF registry likely emerges

## Key Finding 2: Influence vs. Acceptance Matrix

### What We Can Influence (HIGH PRIORITY)

| Area | Feasibility | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Claude discovery experience | High | Build best-in-class MCP servers |
| Skill quality standards | Medium-High | Propose scoring to community |
| Author success metrics | High | Provide analytics and feedback |
| Community curation burden | Medium | Offer automated quality signals |

### What We Must Accept (CONSTRAINTS)

| Constraint | Why Unchangeable | Strategy |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Ecosystem fragmentation | 17+ registries exist | Federate, don't replace |
| Vendor tool lock-in | Competition dynamics | Claude-first, expand later |
| Security trust deficit | Historical incidents | Build trust gradually |
| Cross-platform adoption | AAIF timeline | Wait for standards |

---

## Key Finding 3: Essential Partnerships

### Tier 1: Essential

| Partner | Why Essential | What to Seek |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Anthropic** | Integration, legitimacy | Official listing, API access, co-marketing |
| **Existing Registries** | Bootstrap catalog | Federation protocol, data sharing |
| **GitHub** | Skills hosted there | API access, quality signals |

### Tier 2: Important

| Partner | Why Important | What to Seek |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Awesome List Maintainers** | Curated quality | Submission API, badge adoption |
| **AAIF** | Industry standards | Standards participation |

### Partnership Strategy

Focus Tier 1 first:
1. Anthropic partnership validates legitimacy
2. Registry federation provides bootstrap catalog
3. GitHub integration enables quality scoring

---

## Key Finding 4: Cold Start Solution

### The Challenge

> "The biggest initial hurdle to getting your online marketplace running is creating that initial supply or demand."

### Recommended Four-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Bootstrap Supply**
- Index 500+ skills from existing sources
- Filter to minimum quality threshold
- Create searchable catalog

**Phase 2: Tool-First Value**
- Codebase scanner provides immediate value
- Users get recommendations without contributing
- "Come for the tool, stay for the network"

**Phase 3: Demand Activation**
- Contextual recommendations after scan
- Discovery becomes valuable
- First network effects emerge

**Phase 4: Network Growth**
- "Developers like you use..."
- Team skill sharing
- Author analytics attract creators

### Key Insight

> "Offer a tool that solves a critical problem for the supply side."

Codebase scanner solves the user's immediate need ("what skills help my project?") without requiring network participation.

---

## Key Finding 5: Governance Requirements

### Quality Standards Governance

**Challenge:**
> "The long-term stewardship of the standard remains undefined, and whether it will fall under AAIF or require its own governance structure is an open question."

**Recommended Approach:**
- Publish scoring methodology openly
- Accept community proposals
- Regular transparency reports
- Community advisory group

### Security Policy Governance

**Challenge:**
> "Organizations will need to establish clear processes for auditing, testing, and deploying skills from trusted sources."

**Recommended Approach:**
- Define trust tiers with clear criteria
- Document verification processes
- Enable enterprise policy overrides
- Publish security scan results

---

## Key Finding 6: Capability Requirements

### Must Build (Core Product)

| Capability | Complexity | Phase |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Skill indexing | Medium | 1 |
| Quality scoring | Medium | 1 |
| MCP servers | Medium | 1 |
| Federation protocol | Medium | 1 |
| Codebase scanning | High | 1 |
| Recommendation engine | Medium | 2 |

### Can Acquire/Partner

| Capability | Source |
|------------|--------|
| Initial catalog | Existing registries |
| Security scanning | GitHub API, Snyk |
| Search infrastructure | Meilisearch |
| Community ratings | SkillsMP |

### Can Defer

| Capability | Why Defer | When |
|------------|-----------|------|
| Cross-platform support | AAIF timeline | Phase 2+ |
| Enterprise SSO | Enterprise phase | Phase 3 |
| Skill creation tools | Authors have tools | Phase 2 |

---

## Key Finding 7: Risk Assessment

### Major Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Anthropic builds competing feature | Medium | High | Position as complement, seek partnership |
| AAIF creates official registry | Medium-High | Medium | Build AAIF-compatible, ready to federate |
| Cold start failure | Medium | High | Tool-first value, bootstrap from existing |
| Quality standards rejected | Low-Medium | Medium | Publish openly, accept feedback |

### Risk Acceptance

Two risks are acceptable:
- **AAIF registry:** Can federate with or contribute to official registry
- **Standards rejection:** Iterate based on community feedback

Two risks require active mitigation:
- **Anthropic competition:** Must establish partnership early
- **Cold start:** Must execute tool-first strategy correctly

## Connection to Complete Framework

### How Layer 6 Completes the Teresa Torres Framework

| Layer | Question | Finding |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | What does customer say? | "Black box," "don't know enough" |
| 2 | How do others feel impact? | Authors: distribution pain; Ecosystem: fragmentation |
| 3 | What behaviors block solutions? | Status quo bias, context preservation |
| 4 | What attempts have been made? | Curation burnout, registry fragmentation |
| 5 | Where does technology enable? | MCP, progressive disclosure, automated scoring |
| **6** | **What can we influence?** | **Claude experience, quality standards, federation** |

### The Complete Problem Definition

Based on all six layers:

> **Claude Code users operate at 20% of potential because skill discovery is invisible, fragmented, and requires proactive effort that efficient workflows discourage. Existing solutions fail due to curation burnout and registry fragmentation. Technical capabilities exist to solve this via MCP-based discovery with automated quality scoring. The AAIF formation creates a strategic window to establish quality standards and federation protocols for the Claude ecosystem, with potential expansion to AAIF-compatible platforms.**

### The Complete Solution Definition

> **Build MCP-based Discovery Hub that provides ambient skill discovery with automated quality scoring, federated with existing registries, positioned as infrastructure complement to the emerging AAIF ecosystem. Execute tool-first cold start via codebase scanner, establish partnerships with Anthropic and existing registries, and move quickly to set quality standards before ecosystem solidifies.**
