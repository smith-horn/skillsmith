## Complete Problem Definition

Based on all six layers:

> **Claude Code users operate at 20% of potential because skill discovery is invisible, fragmented, and requires proactive effort that efficient workflows discourage. Existing solutions fail due to curation burnout and registry fragmentation. Technical capabilities exist to solve this via MCP-based discovery with automated quality scoring. The AAIF formation creates a strategic window to establish quality standards and federation protocols for the Claude ecosystem, with potential expansion to AAIF-compatible platforms.**

## Complete Solution Definition

> **Build MCP-based Discovery Hub that provides ambient skill discovery with automated quality scoring, federated with existing registries, positioned as infrastructure complement to the emerging AAIF ecosystem. Execute tool-first cold start via codebase scanner, establish partnerships with Anthropic and existing registries, and move quickly to set quality standards before ecosystem solidifies.**
