**Archetype:** The Choice-Paralyzed Developer

> *"There are too many options. Just tell me what works."*

---

## Demographics

- 1-3 years experience OR senior dev in unfamiliar domain
- High anxiety about making wrong choices
- Prefers guidance over options
- May not have vocabulary to search effectively

---

## Goals

| Functional | Emotional |
|------------|-----------|
| Get a working setup quickly | Relief from decision burden |
| Follow trusted guidance | Confidence in choices |
| Learn what they need to know | Reduced anxiety about gaps |
| Avoid obvious mistakes | Safety from embarrassment |

---

## Fears and Anxieties

- Paralysis from too many choices
- Installing wrong skill and causing problems
- Looking incompetent to peers
- Missing something obvious everyone else knows
- Wasting time becoming a "tool expert"

---

## Current Behavior and Workarounds

- Asks colleagues what they use
- Follows "beginner" tutorials exactly
- Avoids exploration, sticks to known paths
- Feels anxious in settings/configuration screens
- Often abandons tools before discovering value

---

## Trust Triggers (What Builds Confidence)

- Single clear recommendation ("if you install one thing...")
- Curated bundles ("React Developer Starter Pack")
- Social proof ("87% of React developers install this")
- Quick time estimates ("30 seconds to install")
- Clear reversibility ("easy to undo")

---

## Delight Triggers (What Creates Joy)

- Something working on first try
- Realizing the recommended choice was perfect
- Discovering they knew enough to succeed
- Feeling competent rather than overwhelmed
- Having someone else make decisions for them

---

## Preferred Entry Points

1. **VS Code extension** with visual interface
2. **Web browser** with category browsing
3. **Guided setup wizard** in terminal
4. **"Quick start" curated bundles**

---

## Red Flags That Cause Abandonment

- "Choose from 50,000 skills"
- Advanced features visible on first screen
- Technical jargon in descriptions
- Required decisions before value
- No default or recommended option

---

## Specific Onboarding Message for Overwhelmed

```
Let's keep this simple.

I've analyzed your project and found one skill that would
help most right now:

  frontend-design
  "Helps create distinctive, production-grade interfaces"
  Used by 78% of React + TypeScript developers

[Install This One] [Show Me 2 More Options] [I'll Explore Later]

You can always change your mind. This takes 30 seconds to undo.
```

## Design Principles for This Persona

1. Never show more than 3 options at once
2. Always provide a "recommended" choice
3. Include escape hatches that don't feel like failure
4. Use language like "this takes 30 seconds" to reduce perceived risk

## Design Implications

### For Discovery Features
- Lead with single, clear recommendation
- Provide curated bundles by use case
- Show strong social proof

### For Search
- Suggest search terms when empty
- Show "most popular" defaults
- Use plain language, not jargon

### For Recommendations
- Maximum 3 options at a time
- Always highlight recommended choice
- Include time estimates and reversibility

### For Installation
- One-click with clear confirmation
- Show exactly what's happening
- Celebrate success briefly

### For Ongoing Experience
- Gentle, infrequent suggestions
- Never overwhelm with options
- Provide clear "next step" guidance

## Quick Card

**Motivation:** "Just tell me what to do"
**Fear:** Wrong choice, looking incompetent
**Entry Point:** VS Code, guided wizard
