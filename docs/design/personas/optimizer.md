**Archetype:** The Efficiency-Focused Developer

> *"Every tool I add needs to earn its place in my workflow."*

---

## Demographics

- 5-10 years experience
- Productivity-focused, tracks time and efficiency
- Uses Claude Code for specific, targeted tasks
- Skeptical of "productivity tools" that add overhead

---

## Goals

| Functional | Emotional |
|------------|-----------|
| Find skills that save measurable time | Feel efficient and optimized |
| Integrate without workflow disruption | Confidence that setup is right |
| Minimize tool-switching overhead | Pride in lean, effective setup |
| Get ROI on time invested in discovery | Justified investment feeling |

---

## Fears and Anxieties

- Adding complexity that slows them down
- Skills that break existing workflows
- Time spent configuring instead of coding
- Being sold on something that doesn't deliver

---

## Current Behavior and Workarounds

- Searches only when facing specific problem
- Evaluates skills by reading all documentation first
- Tests in isolated environment before real projects
- Rarely installs more than 2-3 skills total

---

## Trust Triggers (What Builds Confidence)

- Clear, measurable value propositions
- Quick install and equally quick uninstall
- Testimonials from similar use cases
- Performance benchmarks or time savings data
- No persistent background processes

---

## Delight Triggers (What Creates Joy)

- A skill that works exactly as documented
- Discovering they were doing something manually that could be automated
- Clean uninstall with zero residue
- Time savings visualization after use

---

## Preferred Entry Points

1. **VS Code extension** with context-aware suggestions
2. **Terminal** for targeted search
3. **Standalone CLI** for evaluation before commitment

---

## Red Flags That Cause Abandonment

- Vague value propositions ("makes coding better")
- Long setup processes
- Skills that require configuration before first use
- No clear uninstall path
- Recommendations for skills they don't need

---

## Design Implications

### For Discovery Features
- Show time savings estimates where possible
- Highlight "zero-config" skills prominently
- Display performance impact data

### For Search
- Support problem-based search ("how to mock APIs")
- Show clear, measurable descriptions
- Filter by "no setup required"

### For Recommendations
- Be conservative - fewer, more relevant suggestions
- Explain specific value for their codebase
- Never recommend what they already have or don't need

### For Installation
- One-command install with immediate verification
- Show exactly what will be added/changed
- Provide one-command uninstall immediately after

### For Ongoing Experience
- Track and display time savings
- Don't interrupt workflow for suggestions
- Provide usage analytics on demand
