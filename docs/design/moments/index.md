## Moment Design Principles

### 1. Timing Is Everything
- Trust moments must be immediate and reliable
- Delight moments should appear at natural pause points
- Never interrupt flow states

### 2. Honesty Over Impression
- First impressions should be accurate, not impressive
- Failures should be acknowledged, not hidden
- Celebrations should be proportionate to achievement

### 3. Escape Routes Everywhere
- Every moment should have a clear exit
- Dismissal should never feel like failure
- User control is always preserved

### 4. Context Awareness
- Moments should reflect user's current state
- Emotional tone should match situation
- Frequency should respect user preferences
